I am a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University advised by Prof. [P. R. Kumar](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/pkumar.html). My research centers on cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity. Working with these systems brings me immense satisfaction as I witness their real-world applications. Despite the challenges posed by the interdisciplinary nature of cyber-physical systems, I embrace the opportunity to learn across various fields. Guided by my advisor's approach of not limiting ourselves to a specific domain, I consider myself a dedicated problem solver.
